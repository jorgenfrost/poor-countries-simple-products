# Data 

- How much hydro-generation and capacity in each state? - SE INFLOW AND GENERATION in Annual Review of Hydro Power Performance

- Where is each power plants output contractually allocated to? Have not found source outside of Allcott data.

- How much power does each hydro plant generate? - SE GENERATION PERFORMANCE in Annual Review of Hydro Power Performance

- Which hydro power plants are run of river and which are reservoirs? 

- How much inflow is there to each reservoir? - SE INFLOW AND GENERATION in Annual Review of Hydro Power Performance

# TODO 

GET:

1. C - annual hydro generation capacity

2. c_d - annual generation capacity for plant d


3. a_ds - share of plant d's output allocated to state s
